Always on Time

Contributors: Nick Jacobs, Yueyu Wang, Alex Grabowski, Jasmine Priatna

Description: 
 The Always on Time program will allow the user to set tasks to automatically
happen at a time that they select. This can involve setting reminders, or assigning
a script to run at a certain time. This would be aimed at people who are very busy 
and have alot to keep track of every day. The user can schedule events, change 
settings, and see a visual diagram of showing upcoming events. When adding an event, 
you can set the title, time, and date and anything else you need to complete the 
event (text, images, or a script to run).
